##  What I Learned

Some of the key topics I explored include:

- 🔹 Registers, Register Cache, and RAM structure
- 🔹 Loops, functions, jumps, and labels in Assembly
- 🔹 Segmented memory model 
- 🔹 Extended multiplication, shifting, and bitwise operations
- 🔹 Writing a Hello World program on a 32-bit machine using NASM
- 🔹 Stack memory, function frame layout, and parameter passing
- 🔹 Writing to video memory and direct memory access in 16-bit
- 🔹 Concepts like CISC vs RISC architecture, latency, and throughput
