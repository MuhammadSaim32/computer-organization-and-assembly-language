 Why We Convert to ASCII for Printing

Computers store all data (numbers, text, etc.) in binary.

Screens/terminals only show characters like '0', 'A', '@' using ASCII or Unicode codes.

To display a number (e.g. 452), it must be:

Split into digits → 4, 5, 2

Converted to ASCII → '4' = 0x34, '5' = 0x35, '2' = 0x32

Sent to screen as character codes

🔁 This process is the same in modern systems, but programming languages (like C, Python) handle the conversion for you automatically.

🧠 Final Point:

Binary values must be converted to ASCII/Unicode if you want to print them as readable text.
