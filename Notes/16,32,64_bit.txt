ğŸ§  What Does 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit System Mean?

Bit System Meaning:
A "bit system" (like 32-bit or 64-bit) tells us how much data the CPU can handle at once.

This is based on the size of the CPU's general-purpose registers.

ğŸ“¦ What Are Registers?
Registers are very small and fast memory locations inside the CPU.

A 32-bit register holds 32 bits (4 bytes), and a 64-bit register holds 64 bits (8 bytes).

So when we say a system is 32-bit, we mean its CPU registers are 32 bits wide.

ğŸ“Š Why It Matters:
Bigger registers can process larger data at once.

Bigger register size also means the CPU can use more RAM:

32-bit systems can handle up to ~4 GB of RAM.

64-bit systems can handle more than 1 TB (in theory).

ğŸ”„ Real-World Impact:
16-bit systems are outdated and were used in early computers.

32-bit systems were used in the 90sâ€“2000s.

64-bit systems are standard now in almost all modern PCs and phones.
