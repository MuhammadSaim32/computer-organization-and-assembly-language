Bytecode: An intermediate, low-level representation of a program, typically compiled from a high-level language (like Python or Java).

Purpose: Bytecode is platform-independent and executed by a virtual machine (VM), which translates it into machine code for a specific platform.

Bytecode is called so because its instructions (called opcodes) are usually 1 byte (8 bits) long.
 These byte-sized opcodes, along with optional operands, form a consize, intermediate code that can be interpreted  by a virtual machine (VM).

üíæ What Happens in DOSBox (Simplified)

DOSBox is a virtual machine that pretends to be a 16-bit DOS system, so you can run old DOS programs on a modern 64-bit machine.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Emulates Old Hardware
DOSBox creates fake 16-bit CPU, memory, and I/O to run DOS programs.

Translates 16-bit to 64-bit

DOSBox converts old 16-bit instructions into modern 64-bit ones that your CPU understands.

Runs Inside Linux

Linux (64-bit OS) runs DOSBox like any app, and DOSBox handles all the conversion internally.

üß† What You See

You see the DOS program running normally, like on an old PC.

Behind the scenes, DOSBox is translating everything.

It may run a bit slower due to this software emulation overhead.
